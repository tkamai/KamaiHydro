We reside in The Volcani Center (https://www.agri.gov.il), where agriculture proudly remains as first priority. Agriculture is one of the most important aspects in our life, as a huge water consumer for irrigation and the source for most of our food. On the one hand, agriculture is depleting our resources by using land and water resource that have significant effects on our environment, while on the other it is an essential foundation for food production. Therefore, a significantly importan part of our efforts is research objected towards improving agriculture practices of water-use efficiency and sustainability.
