## Foci

We attemt to conduct thorough reaserch with an holistic approach for understanding complex system.

We aim for simplifying our studies by concidering the major mechanisms that control the processes in hand and to those that have practical meaning and interests.

Thus, our general research path includes:
- controlled experiments for producing unique data.
- model development.
- validation of the model/s with data.
- applications under field conditions.
- furture predictions - with optimazations 

We strive to gain knowledge and find solutions for improving water use efficiency and sustainability of water resources. Our research is aimed towards predicting water storage and consumption in natural, urban, and agricultural systems by combining fundamental understanding and applicative tools for quantifying water state and flow, their relations to temperature and coupling with heat transfer and transport phenomena of different constituents.

Major research topics include:
- development and applications of measurement techniques
- parameter optimization
- irrigation and water in the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Continuum (SPAC)
- environmental interactions and impacts.

## Why?

Lack of water is a common issue around the world. In this era, water scarcity is one of the utmost pressing issues for survival, as water demand exceeds supply in most of the world, and in many regions these conditions are extreme due to high consumption of water relative to the limited resources that are already exploited and diminishing. The increasing demand for food and the decreasing availability of soil and water resources are expected to continue with both, the expanding worldâ€™s population, and with higher temperatures and extreme weather events as result of climatic change. These changes are pressing the environment and intensifying water scarcity conditions that, in turn, require higher efficiency in water use and in food production for long-term sustainability in this changing world.

## Where?

Most of the water around the globe is saline in the oceans (~97%). As part of the water cycle, water that evaporates from the oceans to the atmosphere, precipitates on the land, from there it evaporates and transpires back to the atmosphere, and also flows back to the ocean on the surface and through the subsurface via the soil and groundwater. Although there are very small changes in global water amounts, natural changes and man-made activities may alter storage between resources, thereby leading to water depletion of vital water resources.

Out of the global water, freshwater is only ~3%. About 2/3 of those freshwater are in groundwater aquifers. Most of the remaining freshwater (~1%) are surface water. Soil water is less than 0.01% out of the global water, and ~0.05% of freshwater. However, the importance of soil water to the global energy, food production, and water balance far outweighs its physical amount. Soils serve as foundation and primary reservoir of nutrients for agriculture and natural ecosystems, and mediate most of the lifesustaining interactions among land, surface water and atmosphere. Fundamentally, soil moisture provides the water resource pool for transpiring plants, and is also an important source of atmospheric water via evapotranspiration. Soil moisture controls microbial activity, influences redox conditions, and regulates important processes such as nitrification, denitrification and CO2 production via soil and plant respiration.

## What?

We study subsurface properties together with mechanisms and processes related to water state and flow in the critical zone. We pursue a holistic approach through all stages of research. We seek to find solutions for sustainable systems with minimal impact of water use on the environment, and use multi-process and -physics coupling methodologies for studying the complex nature of water state and flow, gas transport, contaminant transport, salinity, and heat transfer. Research is conducted by combining computational and experimental models for understanding fundamental processes and mechanisms, and field observations for studying those in a variety of systems and settings.

We deal with the properties of the subsurface -- soil, porous. fractured, and karst -- media, such as texture and density, and their relation to water state, storage, and flow. As hydrologists, we view water as the main source for life, and the major driver for transport of chemicals and energy in the subsurface. The subsurface encompasses complex heterogeneity with an array of temporal nonlinear physical and biogeochemical processes. The upper part of the subsurface is the soil, a very dynamic region, driven by atmospheric conditions and exposed to processes of infiltration, evaporation, and water and nutrient uptake by roots, which lead to significant fluctuations in water content, temperature, and biological and chemical concentrations and compositions. The connection between the surface and the subsurface is the interface between the atmosphere and the soil, either through the bare soil or through plants, in the soil-plant-atmospheric continuum (SPAC). Bellow the soil, the depth of the vadose zone varies and may extend to hundreds of meters, including alluvial and rock formations that may play key roles in determining water state and flow, including their partitioning between liquid and gas phase. Groundwater aquifers at the bottom of the vadose zone are critical water suppliers. The quantity and quality of these water bodies relies on our utilization by pumping and on recharge (infiltration and evaporation) and contamination.
